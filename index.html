        <p>Hello. This is my first post. I made this website for my portofolio, i made this using simple HTML and CSS code. I already made a lot of website prototype (but it's too simple) that you can see in "Projects" section. I'll update all of my website as soon after i finish my learning about JavaScript.</p>

(Viewable in mobile also desktop) I hope, this portofolio can made you happy (lol?). If you have any questions or want to say somethings, you can contact me on Facebook.
